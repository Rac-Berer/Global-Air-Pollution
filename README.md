**Global-Air-Pollution** 
This dataset contains AQI (Air Quality Index) of different pollutants for many cities around the world.
Think of AQI as a yardstick that runs from 0 to 500. The higher the AQI value, the greater the level of air pollution and the greater the health concern.

By definition, Air Pollution is contamination of the indoor or outdoor environment by any chemical, physical or biological agent that modifies the natural characteristics of the atmosphere. 
Household combustion devices, motor vehicles, industrial facilities and forest fires are common sources of air pollution. 
Pollutants of major public health concerns include particulate matter, carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide.
Outdoor and indoor air pollution causes respiratory and other diseases and are important sources of morbidity and mortality.


â€¢	Carbon Monoxide [CO]: Carbon Monoxide is a gas that is colorless and odorless. All vehicles or machineries that burn fossil fuels emit CO, as well as gas stoves and gas/kerosene space heaters.  Breathing a high concentration of CO reduces the amount of oxygen that can be transported in the blood stream to critical organs like the heart and brain. At very high levels, which are not likely to occur outdoor but which are possible in enclosed environments. CO can cause dizziness, confusion, unconsciousness and death.
